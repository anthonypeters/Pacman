# Pacman
# By: Anthony Peters

This is a pacman game I wrote for my Python class. It was written using pygame and IDLE.

I failed to finsih this program in its entirety, but it fulfilled the requirements for the assignment at the time.

What I want to finalize is a working enemy class, a working Graph Shortest Path algorithm for the enemies, a game over screen, and a database to track high scores.
